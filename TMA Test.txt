	1.2.5.6
On same subnet? Why?

Class A: 
	1.2.3.4/8
Host address            - 1.2.3.4
Network address         - 1.0.0.0
Network mask            - 255.0.0.0
Network range           - 1.0.0.0 - 1.255.255.255
Usable range            - 1.0.0.1 - 1.255.255.254

	1.2.5.6/8
Host address            - 1.2.5.6
Network address         - 1.0.0.0
Network mask            - 255.0.0.0
Network range           - 1.0.0.0 - 1.255.255.255
Usable range            - 1.0.0.1 - 1.255.255.254

==> Class A on same subnet / same network.

Class B:
	1.2.3.4/16
Host address            - 1.2.3.4
Network address         - 1.2.0.0
Network mask            - 255.255.0.0
Network range           - 1.2.0.0 - 1.2.255.255
Usable range            - 1.2.0.1 - 1.2.255.254

	1.2.5.6/16
Host address            - 1.2.5.6
Network address         - 1.2.0.0
Network mask            - 255.255.0.0
Network range           - 1.2.0.0 - 1.2.255.255
Usable range            - 1.2.0.1 - 1.2.255.254

==> Class B on same subnet / same network.

Class C:
	1.2.3.4/24
Host address            - 1.2.3.4
Network address         - 1.2.3.0
Network mask            - 255.255.255.0
Network range           - 1.2.3.0 - 1.2.3.255
Usable range            - 1.2.3.1 - 1.2.3.254

	1.2.5.6/24
Host address            - 1.2.5.6
Network address         - 1.2.5.0
Network mask            - 255.255.255.0
Network range           - 1.2.5.0 - 1.2.5.255
Usable range            - 1.2.5.1 - 1.2.5.254

==> Class C on different subnet / different network.

3. Coverage test 100%
   All 7 principal of test keys
   1 security issue
		Create test cases to verify the login function of a web page of a company. 
		This web page to manage day off of staff.
		There are 3 roles of accounts such as admin, manager and staff. 
		Users with admin role can manage acount (create/modify/delete and reset password). 
		Users with manager role can manage the day off of staff (approve/reject). 
		Users with staff role can submit a day off. 
		An user has multiple roles. 
		There is a specific home page for each user group after login successfully. 
		If a user logins with wrong password 5 times, admin will receive a notify. 
		They will reset the password of this user. 
		The user will receive a email about new password.

4. Programming exercise:
	Write a program to revert input string to output like below:
		input: 	'Automation'
		output: 'oitamotuAn'

5. Shell script compare network subnet of ipv4 & ipv6
	2001::1
	2001:2::2

6. Protocol operates between Layer 2 (Data Link) - 3 (Network) of the OSI model 
	-> Address Resolution Protocol (ARP):
	
	Layer 2 (Data Link):
This layer deals with physical addressing (MAC addresses) and frame transmission between directly connected devices.

	Layer 3 (Network):
This layer handle logical address (IP addresses) and routing data packets across networks.

ARP role:
	bridges the gap between these 2 layers by translating IP addresses to MAC addresses.

How it Works:
	When a device wants to send data to another device on the same network, it first uses ARP to find the MAC address associated with the destination IP address.
